# PicSift: Your Screenshots Found and Shared with Ease.

PicSift is a powerful, open-source tool designed to manage and search screenshots using text recognition. It's built to increase productivity by simplifying the process of finding and sharing screenshots.


## About the project

Screenshots are an essential part of the modern workflow, especially for tech professionals. But, as the number of screenshots grows, finding that one screenshot you've made a while ago is no longer a trivial task. That's where PicSift comes in.

PicSift is developed with a focus on tech workers, particularly those involved in product design and development, where screenshots are used extensively. Its primary goal is to streamline the process of searching and sharing screenshots by using text recognition.


### Key Features

- **Text-Based Search**: PicSift indexes your screenshots, applies text recognition, and allows you to search your library using text. This eliminates the need for endless scrolling through your gallery to find a specific screenshot.
- **Quick Sharing**: Once you've found the right screenshot, you can share it with just a few clicks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: PicSift's clean and intuitive design makes it easy to navigate and manage your screenshot library.

PicSift is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. Whether you're looking for a tool to streamline your workflow, or a project to contribute to, give PicSift a try.
